              <p class="card-text">This paint range is the one directly from Games Workshop and provides a solid foundation to paint your minis as advertised. They have a large variety to suit any painting needs, but can be quite pricy and come in pots that may dry the paint. Most of their paints, however, are very solid.</p>

              <p class="card-text">A miniature paint company that has been around for decades, they have a very large range that is well suited for realistic or very bright paint works. Their paints can also be found in a larger variety of stores, such as Hobby Lobby. Most of their paints have great coverage, and come in droppers that are well suited to painting by brush or airbrush.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Army Painter</h5>
              <p class="card-text">A fairly recent new brand, they have made products to help newcomers as best as possible to paint up their minis to be ready for tabletop games. Their selection of paints has grown, notably, with their speed paints that very thin paints that provide great shading and highlighting with a single coat of paint. A brand worth looking into if desiring quck, but nice looking minis for the tabletop.</p>
