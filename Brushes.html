              <p>These are brushes sold directly by Games Workshop. Each are labeled according to their role in the painting process. These brushes are synthetic, and although they are able to hold paint well, it does mean that they are much more prone to losing their tip. Flaying can also be an issue unless properly cleaned and attended to.</p>

              <p>These brushes, as with many Army Painter products, help newcomers jump into the hobby to paint quickly. There is a large variety of brushes that are labeled according to the role in which they are best suited towards. They have many brush bundles to further assist newcomers. Similar to Citadel, these brushes are also synthetic, thus prone to losing its point and flaying.</p>

              <p>A brush brand that isn't specifically geared towards the hobby, however they are notable in their quality brushes that greatly help well-done paint works. Their brushes use sable-hair which makes them very smooth to surfaces and won't easily lose their tip. These brushes, however, are very expensive and require good maintenance and cleaning. But even for beginners, Windsor & Newton can do a wonderful job for smooth paint finishes.</p>
