  <h4>Models often don't come fully built. Instead, they come in kits and sprues where they must be plucked off and assembled. Many models can be assembled with just hands, but just as many require these tools to fully build and clean them. Here are some that will help in almost any situation!</h4>

            <h5 class="card-title">Clippers</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Clippers help get each piece of a model off of a sprue. Simply clip the model off from the pegs attached to the sprue. Often when clipped, there will be remains of the pegs, known as nubs, that will stick out. You can use your clippers to take off the remainder of the nub, or use a hobby knife to scrape it off if it is too small.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Hobby Knife</h5>
            <p class="card-text">A very good tool that serves multiple purposes. It can remove/shave off any remaining nubs off the model after clipping. It can also remove mold lines off the model (which are small, fine lines that come from the two part molds having the plastic injected). It can be used as a file substitute for an even, clean finish. The knife can also be used to achieve battle damage, cutting pieces to use for a different purpose, etc. These knives are still sharp so always handle with caution (i.e. DO NOT shave or cut towards your hands and fingers when working models/pieces)</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Glue</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Depending on the model, any type of glue won't be necessary. Gunpla models often do not require glue and are push to fit. Many models, however, do require glue to keep pieces together. For the strongest bonds, use either super glue or plastic glue. Super glue can achieve a fast and easy bond, and often requires a lot of force to remove. It is great for ensuring large pieces are able to bond together. Super glue can, however, be dangerous to use if any get on your hands or parts of your body. Plastic glue takes longer to bond than superglue, but melts the plastic together which can make two pieces into one with enough time. It is the most recommended for most model lines such as Games Workshop plastic kits. Keep in mind, plastic glue is wholly ineffective in bonding resin  or metal models together, so use super glue for models made from these materials.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">File</h5>
            <p class="card-text">If any piece might have been damaged, leading to an uneven surface, a file can be used to help even the surface again. While a knife can achieve similar results if used properly, a file is far less likely to result in more damages and there are multiple grades of files to achieve faster or more subtle results.</p>
